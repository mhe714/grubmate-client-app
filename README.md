## Description
In the busy schedules of college students, it can be difficult to conveniently get food from dining options on or around campus due to long wait times during typical meal hours. In addition, some students that prefer to cook for themselves may find it difficult and time consuming to cook for only a small number of people (possibly themselves and a roommate). To solve these problems, a new Android application, GrubMate, shall be built. GrubMate is a platform that enables users to seamlessly share extra food with their friends and to pick up extra portions of food from restaurants for their friends. Those seeking to share food or available to pick up food from restaurants will have their availabilities shown to all or a portion of their friends, and those looking for food can “subscribe” to a certain category of food based on a search term, and then get notified when any such food becomes available. To facilitate communication, the app allows users to confirm requests in the app and provides a link to follow up a discussion in Facebook Messenger. By using this app, college students can share food with others, coordinate with friends to obtain food faster, and discover new varieties of food through their friends.
